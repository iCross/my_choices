# My Choices

Transform default HTML `<select>` tags into Choices.js dropdowns for an enhanced user experience.  

## Usage

- Click on the Violentmonkey menu command to apply [Choices.js](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices)
- Alternatively, use the pre-defined `Ctrl + I` keyboard shortcut

## Features

- Utilizes [Choices.js](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices), a lightweight library without the need for jQuery.  
- Replacing all select tags globally might not be a good idea, so the script waits for user execution.  

## Installation

Tested and compatible with [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) only.
