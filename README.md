If you find it useful, please consider giving it a star.


## Usage

- Alternatively, use the pre-defined `Ctrl + I` keyboard shortcut

## Features

- Utilizes [Choices.js](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices), a lightweight library without the need for jQuery.  
- Replacing all select tags globally might not be a good idea, so the script waits for user execution.
